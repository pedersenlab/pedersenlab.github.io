# Abstract

We describe a surgical procedure for chronically implanting a Doppler ultrasonic probe around the tail artery of the rat to measure phasic flow velocity in the tail artery of the unrestrained conscious rat. The phasic tail flow signal is highly correlated with the simultaneously recorded superior mesenteric flow signal (range 0.70-0.89 in seven rats) during vasoconstriction induced by exposure to formaldehyde vapour. In response to two quick alerting taps on the cage, tail flow velocity fell from 20+/-2 to 7+/-1 cm/s (P<0.01) and mesenteric flow fell from 30+/-5 to 25+/-4 cm/s (P<0.05), with the fall in tail flow being significantly greater than the fall in mesenteric flow (P<0.05, n=7 rats). In anesthetized rats, the phasic tail flow signal was highly correlated with phasic arterial pressure (range 0.71-0.83 in seven rats). The ability to reliably measure phasic arterial tail flow in the conscious unrestrained rat should facilitate experimental studies of brain pathways regulating flow to this principally cutaneous vascular bed in different physiological situations.
