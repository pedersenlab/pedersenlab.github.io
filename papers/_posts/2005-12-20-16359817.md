# Abstract

Previous studies using c-Fos immunohistochemistry suggest that a sub-population of neurons in the midbrain periaqueductal gray region is activated during opioid withdrawal. The neurochemical identity of these cells is unknown but cellular physiological studies have implicated GABAergic neurons. The present study investigated whether GABAergic neurons are activated in the mouse periaqueductal gray during opioid withdrawal using dual-antibody immunohistochemistry for Fos and glutamic acid decarboxylase. Both chronic opioid treatment and naloxone-precipitated opioid withdrawal increased Fos expression in the periaqueductal gray, with the greatest increase being four-fold in the caudal ventrolateral subdivision following withdrawal. Neurons stained for both Fos and glutamic acid decarboxylase were greatly enhanced in all subdivisions of the periaqueductal gray following withdrawal, particularly in the lateral and ventrolateral divisions where the increase was up to 70-fold. These results suggest that activation of a subpopulation of GABAergic interneurons in the periaqueductal gray plays a role in opioid withdrawal.
