# Abstract

The rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) is an important site of opioid actions and forms part of an analgesic pathway that projects to the spinal cord. The neuronal mechanisms by which opioids act within this brain region remain unclear, particularly in relation to the neurotransmitters GABA and serotonin. In the present study, we examined serotonergic and GABAergic immunoreactivity, identified using immunohistochemistry for tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) and glutamate decarboxylase (GAD), in combination with in vitro whole cell patch clamping to investigate the role of opioids on the mouse RVM with identified projections to the spinal cord. Tyr-d-Ala-Gly-N-Me-Phe-Gly-ol enkephalin (DAMGO) produced μ-opioid receptor-mediated outward currents in virtually all TPH-immunoreactive projecting neurons and GAD-immunoreactive nonprojecting neurons (87% and 86%). The other groups of RVM neurons displayed mixed responsiveness to DAMGO (40-68%). Deltorphin II and U-69593 produced δ- and κ-opioid receptor-mediated outward currents in smaller subpopulations of RVM neurons, with many of the δ-opioid responders forming a subpopulation of μ-opioid-sensitive GABAergic nonprojecting neurons. These findings are consistent with prior electrophysiological and anatomic studies in the rat RVM and indicate that both serotonergic and GABAergic RVM neurons mediate the actions of μ-opioids. Specifically, μ-opioids have a direct postsynaptic inhibitory influence over both GABAergic and serotonergic neurons, including those that project to the dorsal spinal cord.
