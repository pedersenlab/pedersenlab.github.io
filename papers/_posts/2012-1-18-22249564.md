# Abstract

We describe an unusual case of cerebral intravascular lymphomatosis wherein the         patient presented with multiple embolic strokes predominantly in the posterior         circulation. Using this case as an illustration, we review the literature of this         malignancy, which consists of extranodal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. For patients         with recurrent stroke-like events without cardiac risk factors, the accurate diagnosis         requires a high index of suspicion by the neurologist and a brain biopsy specimen         demonstrating lymphoma cells within the lumen of cerebral blood vessels.         Intravascular lymphomatosis can be treated with systemic chemotherapies, but the         response rate and pattern of relapse remain unknown.
